  "notes": "Boil the chickpeas in turmeric first. When adding chickpeas to masala with yogurt / raisins / almonds, do not add more water, the recipe is hydrophobic. The almonds also need to be soaked for a few hours before adding. Note that I think ghee makes it worse. Porcini mushroom powder is non-indian but it helps a ton by adding depth, and lemon adds brightness. Cilantro is better than kasoori if available.",
