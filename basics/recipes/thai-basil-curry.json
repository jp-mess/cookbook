  "notes": "first reduce coconut milk in a pan to just fat. add green curry paste and further reduce. add mortal/pestle basil leaves (spinach) to boost green color. add chicken if using. add more coconut milk. add chicken stock if using chicken. add palm sugar/fish sauce. too many green beans ruins it and i think they should be pre-steamed or blanched",
